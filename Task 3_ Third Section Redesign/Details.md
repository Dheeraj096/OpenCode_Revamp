## Task 3: Third Section Redesign
Your **Third Task** is to redesign the **Testimonial Section of the OpenCode Website**.
This issue is **OPEN TO ALL.**
No need to claim this issue.
NO SUBMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER **14th October 11:59 PM**.

This is our OpenCode Website: [https://opencodeiiita.github.io/](https://opencodeiiita.github.io/)

The only constraint is the original info should be contained in the redesign. Apart from that, there is no rule! You have complete design freedom, showcase your creativity, and improve this section ðŸ™‚

The task needs to be done in Figma. Figma is free to use and downloading it is also optional. You can use the browser version of Figma in case you don't want to download it. If you are unclear on how to use it, check the tutorial here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2o9CIdL6Q0&list=PLDtHAiqIa4wa5MBbE_XDoqY51sAkQnkjt&index=21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2o9CIdL6Q0&list=PLDtHAiqIa4wa5MBbE_XDoqY51sAkQnkjt&index=21)

**Procedure:**

1. The color scheme should remain the same, if you are changing it, it should go well with the rest of the website.
2. The original information needs to be present in the redesigned section. You can add any new information which you feel should be present
3. Create the section in a Figma file and export it as png. Create PR by submitting the **PNG** and the **Figma file link** in Task 3: Third Section Redesign folder ONLY.

**MDC (Minimum Design Criteria)**:

The testimonial section should definitely look like a section of a complete website, matching the theme, colors, and fonts of the rest of the sections and blending it with the complete website. It definitely shouldn't look like a poster or banner or another form of print media. All the original content must be present. 

Make sure that you use a grid while designing the section.

Since it is a 20 point task we would at least be eagerly looking for proper use of two of the design principles: Repetition and Alignment, which would be most utilized in this section. Submission missing on these basic principles along with other details mentioned above will be required to rework their designs.

The frame width should be **1440px.**

The changes made must be significant, simply recreating the original section and submitting it as it is wouldn't fetch you points.
